Description: Distributed generalized linear models (GLM) fitting using 
    Fisher scoring.  Models are to be fit using a primary-secondary 
    relationship, where the results are written to a synced folder, but
    data can be elsewhere though it is loaded in memory.  Additional functions
    are available for deploying a plumber 'API'.
